function alpha = forward_variable(observations, states, logInit, logA, logEm)
% forward_variable(observations, states, init, A, emission)
% calculates the value of the forward variable
% for a given hidden Markov model
% see Rabiner 1989, IEEE 77(2), Section III.A

% observations is a vector struct of observed current levels
% observations struct contains 'level_mean' and 'level_stdv' fields
% states is a vector struct of model current levels
% states struct contains 'level_mean', 'level_stdv', and 'stdv_mean' fields

% logInit is the log10 initial probabilities
% logA is the log10 transition matrix probabilities
% logEm is the log10 precomputed emission matrix
% returns the probability of observing 'observation' from the model state
% 'state' (NOT log prob)
